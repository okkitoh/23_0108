Meh it's BROKEN and SHELVED.
Some thoughts, there's alot of redundancy between item categories which are muddled by special 
cases. So any sort of design would be a tradeoff between increasing complexity vs space/effort.
Complexity being the handling of special cases.
Space/effort being having to write 10+ filter generators for each category.
